Welcome to the Funda Project repository! This is a test automation framework built using Playwright and NUnit, designed for testing websites with various functionalities.

This project aims to test the functionalities of the Funda website, focusing on key user actions like:
- Searching for properties with and without search criteria.
- Navigating through the homepage and verifying the visibility of critical UI elements.
